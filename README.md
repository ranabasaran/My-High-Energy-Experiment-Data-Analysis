Hello, I analyzed the data obtained from the results of high-energy collision experiments in the files you see here.
You can see codes written in Python and C++. 
Some of them are Monte Carlo simulation data and some are data taken from CERN's ATLAS experiment.
I won't share the raw data here.

My analyzes include mass analyzes of the Z, W and Higgs bosons.
Electron, muon and heavy quark channels were used in these analyses.
One of the Python files contains the codes required to compare simulation data and real data on the canvas.
The analysis of the data was done through the ROOT framework.
I can also show the background of the codes to those who are interested.
